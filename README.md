# StickyReader Web Application

## What is this project about?
 StickyReader is a web-based application being developed using
 modern technologies such as ReactJS for frontend and NodeJS for backend.
 This would be a sample project for my CV.

## What does this application do?
 StickyReader helps users to track what they've learnt/read so far by allowing user to create learning/reading paths for each book that has been started to read and writing/adding unlimited abstractions (short summary of what they've learnt/read) to each reading path. User can also use this application as a recap-tool for recalling what they've learnt/read so far.
