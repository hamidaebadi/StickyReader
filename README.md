# Diary Learner Web Application

## What is this project about?
 Diary learner application is a web-based application being developed using
 modern technologies such as ReactJS for frontend and also NodeJS for backend.
 This would be a sample project for my CV.

## What does this application offer?
 DiaryLearner helps users to track what they've learnt so far by allowing user to create learning paths for each topic
 and writing/adding unlimited abstractions (short summary of what they've learnt) to each learning path. User can also
 use this application as a recap-tool for recalling what they've learnt so far.
